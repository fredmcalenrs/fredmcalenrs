Refinancing the loan: If you’re able to refinance, the co-signer is removed and you become solely responsible for paying off the loan. However, you’ll need to meet a lender’s income and credit requirements in order to refinance the loan.
Consolidating loans: Securing one student loan that consolidates several student loans may enable you to remove a co-signer. As with refinancing, a lender will consider your income and credit before approving an application for a loan consolidation.
